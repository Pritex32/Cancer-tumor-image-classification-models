# Cancer-tumor-image-classification-models
use the model for both lung cancer scan,brain tumor scan and kidney stone scan images (https://multi-cancer-tumor-image-classification-models-cexxm7g9a45cgga.streamlit.app/)

# About the Model
### this app consist of three(3) models for different purpose
- for lung cancer tumor scan prediction
- for brain tumor
- for kidney stone

### I used convolutional neural network for image classification to achive this
### Accuracy is over 90%

## Data Source :
is from kaggle.com

# Importance of this project:
## Developing a cancer model for brain, kidney, and lung cancers is vital for improving healthcare outcomes. It enables early detection, faster and more accurate diagnosis, and supports healthcare professionals by acting as a decision-support tool. Early diagnosis reduces treatment costs and improves patient survival rates.

### The model facilitates personalized treatment plans, advancing cancer research, and identifying new biomarkers or therapeutic targets. It also bridges healthcare gaps in remote areas by enabling remote diagnosis and raises awareness about the importance of early detection. Overall, this project has the potential to save lives, enhance patient outcomes, and transform cancer care globally.
